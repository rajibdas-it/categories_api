### Project Description

##### The project is a nested category model that allows users to organize categories in a hierarchical structure. It is built using TypeScript, Node.js, and Express.js to create the server-side functionality. MongoDB is used as the database, and Mongoose is utilized for creating models and interacting with the database. The application provides various routes to manage categories. Users can create parent and child categories, where child categories are nested under parent categories. The API supports category routes for creating, updating, and deleting categories. Additionally, there are routes for searching categories based on specific criteria. One important feature of the project is the ability to deactivate categories. When a user deactivates a category, all its child categories are also deactivated. This ensures that the entire hierarchy of categories is efficiently managed and reflects the status of the parent category. By using this application, users can effectively organize and manage categories in a nested structure, perform CRUD operations on categories, search for specific categories, and easily deactivate categories along with their child categories when needed.
